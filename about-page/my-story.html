                <h2>How I learned to code.</h2>
                <!--small basic-->
                <p>
                    I first learned how to code using Microsoft Small Basic for our computer literacy course in 9th grade. 
                    I made simple programs like a BMI calculator, autobiography maker, and bootleg Tetris. 
                    I was compelled with how I was able to manipulate the computer and create interesting things with it.
                </p>
                <!--freecodecamp-->
                <p>
                    When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I was stuck at home -- like everybody else. 
                    Being bored and essentially losing my social life, I took the responsive web development course of FreeCodeCamp.org and received my certification.
                    It was a fun learning experience and helped me create the foundation of my frontend development and design skills.
                </p>
                <!--sen high-->
                <p>
                    In my senior year of high school, being a STEM major, our final major requirement was for us to create a research study on mathematics and create a mobile application.
                    We created the app using the MIT App Inventor, which was a step-back from my text-based code experience, however taught me some advanced topics like backend, databases and user authentication.</p>
                <!--college-->
                <p>Entering college in 2022, I learned Java and the advanced computing concepts that essentially shaped me to be capable of writing full stack code; essentially the software engineer that I am today. 
                    Obviously, I couldn't tell much about it since I am still pursuing my undergraduate studies. Check back soon for more.</p>

                <h2>How design found me.</h2>
                <!--childhood-->
                <p>
                    Before dreaming of becoming a software engineer, I was very much inclined to becoming an architect.
                    As a kid, around aged 10-12, I loved to draw these grand buildings and houses with colonial architecture.
                    I thought it was set-in-stone, but everything changed when I was finally allowed to use my mom's desktop PC.
                    The only thing I kept playing besides Plants vs Zombies was Minecraft. This was the 2010s, so Minecraft was pretty simple and barebones.
                    Even then, I turned my architecture illustrations to reality in Minecraft.
                </p>
                <!--initial photoshop experience-->
                <p>
                    Then, I found my groove and style in designing when I explored Adobe Photoshop in 6th grade.
                    Essentially, my introduction to graphic designing. 
                    I wanted to design a logo for my GTA 5 Online crew. 
                    From then on, I started to design my own logos for fun. 
                    Entering high school, I would create my own templates for infographics, illustrations, and magazines.
                </p>
                <!--graphic design-->
                <p>
                    Some of my relatives and friends took interest in my work, and hired me to do a few commissions such as logos, infographics, and social media publication materials for their businesses and entertainment.
                    I became a freelance graphic designer as it was a fun and formative experience as I could see my designs become better and better. 
                    I took design seriously when a famous international Cafe, called Yi Fang, contacted me to create a menu for their Baguio branch's Instagram page.
                    I took more commissions before joining the Children's International Summer Village Baguio Chapter as a member of the digital creatives group where I contributed in creating pubmats for our social media platforms.
                    Then, I stopped taking client works when I got more serious in coding.
                </p>
                <!--college-->
                <p>
                    Entering college, we had plenty of group projects in creating computer-based information systems. 
                    I often led the frontend development team where I would be designing and implementing the UI/UX system.
                    Often hard-coding using the Java Swing library, it honed my careful use of layouts and content managers which I incorporate into my work to this day.
                    Besides the coding aspect, my design skills deepened upon taking our CS 131 Software Modeling and Analysis course where I essentially learned how to conduct requirements analysis and elicitation, software design, software architecture and prototyping.

                <h2>How I fell in love with filmmaking.</h2>
                <!--first film-->
                <p>
                    I made my first short film in 7th grade for a course project. 
                    I was the director and editor. Being my first film, it was messy and unpredictable. 
                    However, it taught me the basics and essentials.
                </p>
                <!--early YouTube-->
                <p>
                    At the time, I was using Sony Vegas 6. 
                    To enhance my editing skills, I created a YouTube channel where I started to create gaming videos on Team Fortress 2, League of Legends, and a bit of Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
                    I learned basic sound editing, transitions, color grading, as well as pacing and dialogue editing.
                    I tried transitioning to creating vlogging content during the peak of Casey Neistat and the rise of the Paul Brothers, but my content was not as well received.
                    I stopped creating content after that to pursue other things.
                </p>
                <!--grade 10-->
                <p>
                    When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, as I am a few months shy from completing my sophomore year, I repursued filmmaking when I volunteered to spearhead a short film in our Filipino course.
                    Our course focused on the literary work of Dr. Jose Rizal's El Filibusterismo. I stepped out of my comfort zone by opting to use Adobe Premiere Pro where I learned advanced editing techniques and explored VFX editing using Adobe After Effects.
                    I thoroughly enjoyed the whole process, being a major upgrade from my previous content, I eventually won as the Media Awardee for my excellent skills in digital arts and filmmaking.

                <p>
                    In senior high school, I was tasked by one of my instructors to be the director of photography and video editor of an upcoming school film for Christmas. I
