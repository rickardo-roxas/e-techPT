                    Marcus Aurelius once said that, “life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.” Johan Rickardo Roxas was born on November 7, 2003 in the foggy mountains of Baguio City, Philippines. Born overweight, Johan grew up to be sickly. Having bronchial asthma, he would be excused from every PE class in the fear of having another attack. Johan lived in fear of running — ironically, he has been running all his life. To compensate for this inability, he resorted to video games. He would play all day and all night; until one day, he discovered how to write simple programs. He was able to make his first web page using HTML at the age of 9. He excelled in his C, SmallBasic and Java programming classes in junior high school, was able to make an android app using MIT App Inventor for his senior high school research, and received further certifications from FreeCodeCamp. It would not be a surprise that he would major in Computer Science.
                    <br><br>Due to his fondness of computers, he learned the necessary skills of video editing. At the age of 13, he started a YouTube channel to become a content creator. He initially started posting gaming content. As his skills grew, he matured into becoming a filmmaker. At the age of 16, he would become a cinematographer. Eventually, he was awarded the Media Awardee – an award given to students with excellence in filmmaking and digital arts – as he graduated from junior high school. He was the first and only one to receive this in Northridge Academy’s history. In senior high school, he became the official video editor and cinematographer for Saint Louis School, Inc. He won Best Cinematographer from the SLSI Share-a-Story Film Festival.
                    <br><br>Johan excelled academically. He has been a consistent honor student since 1st grade. He graduated as the valedictorian in elementary. In junior high school, he was the yearly MTAP candidate, yearly science quiz bee participant, and went on to achieve the Speech Award. He graduated junior high school as the salutatorian from Northridge Academy, Inc. He graduated senior high school in the top 10th percentile out of 200 students. He was awarded the Gerry Roxas Leadership Award by the Gerry Roxas Foundation due to his academic excellence and exemplary spirit in co-curricular and extracurricular activities. Also, some say he was born a leader. In junior high school, he became the vice president of the student council, and maintained to become a class officer in his senior years. Currently, he is the 1st Year Computer Science Representative for Integrated Confederacy in Saint Louis University.
                    <br><br>Out of all the challenges he has faced, Johan was never satisfied. It seemed like there was a void to fill. He overcame his obesity during his 6th grade. The moment his BMI calculated normal, he was overjoyed — but he was still never satisfied. At the age of 16, he meditated on the life of Theodore Roosevelt Jr. Similarly, they both grew up overweight, unfit, and with bronchial asthma. Theodore’s father once explained to him that: “You have the mind but you do not have the body. You must make your body.” Johan took inspiration from this. Each and everyday, he made this his mantra. Thus, at the age of 15, Johan started his fitness journey. He started weightlifting and entering CrossFit — in the hopes of becoming an Olympic weightlifting champion. Johan has not experienced an asthma attack in over 7 years, and never backed down from PE class. Currently, Johan is a bodybuilder weighing 84.5 kilograms at 18% bodyfat. He is able to deadlift 300-lbs, bench 135-lbs, and squat 225-lbs. He aims to compete professionally, both in bodybuilding and CrossFit during his collegiate years.
                    <br><br>This is my story, so far, in my 18 years of life. As a freshman in college, I have a lot to experience — a lot of pain and suffering to endure. I am yet to tap into my true potential, but I strive everyday to be able to see myself in the mirror and tell myself: “We have gone so far. Let us keep on going.” As David Goggins once said, “Many in the world are living such a comfortable life that some die without tapping into their true potential.” This is my story: my body and mind.</p>
