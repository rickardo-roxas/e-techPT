                            <br>
                            <p>It’s in the middle of March 2020. Students slowly prepare for their third quarter examination. The mayor announces a week-long school shutdown. Students praise this occasion, just like any ‘walang pasok’ announcement — not knowing that it’s their last day seeing each other physically. Fast forward to 2022, things are getting better; but things remain uncertain. This is the reality that we all face, and not knowing when it will all end.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            When the pandemic started, I realized how fast things can be “is,” and how fast things can be “was;” to as fast how things are become how things were. An optimistic child, ready to see the world is met by a world of chaos and uncertainty: a state of growth is a state of chaos. I succumbed to a nihilistic belief because of this. “Why do things even matter anymore?” As many of us are unable to answer this paradoxical question, we are left with an unstable state of mind; and it is quite sad how things end up as events unravel. In short, we were all disturbed by this phenomenon, and to all honesty, has disrupted our mental wellbeing. I am no stranger to this, but I am no stranger to being an existentialist, either. It’s either we accept it, or we do not. But that doesn’t stray from the fact that what we face is the reality – no matter how much we try to sugarcoat our experiences.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            The first few months of the pandemic really took a toll on me. I constantly asked myself if all my efforts in life were all worth it: “why do I even bother?” I eventually found the answer after a few more months of asking; and that is that life goes on; and that life really is meant to be difficult. Marcus Aurelius once said that nature doesn’t throw something at us that we cannot handle.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            Those months were also pivotal for me to realize that man is a worker. At this time, I still don’t know any philosophy concepts that Mr. Sales has taught us, for it was in the summer after 10th grade, but I started to philosophize, nevertheless. What am I doing here? Who am I? Am I depressed? Anxious? What is happening to me? Are we all going to die?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            Tough questions for tough times. But I eventually understood that if I keep myself trapped in this nihilistic state, my brain will be fixated to any kind of difficult experiences. I needed to get myself out. I tried, even if I was tired. I was tired reading the news, listening to my friend’s accounts of experiences, and seeing my family be left in the dark, afraid, anxious. Nothing was truly the same anymore, and they never will be again. I had to get myself out.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            I walked and walked, psychologically, to the path of greater resistance. Like a journey in the blizzard of the great German alps; like the treacherous heat under the Sahara sun; like the predatory forest of the Amazon; the poetic accounts of my journey to get out of my mental rut. Then I found my compass, right in front me, through a glowing glass. I walked towards it. Then I saw... myself. I am the compass. I am the way to get myself out. Therefore, to anyone feeling down, you have every right to do so. These are tough times: dark, stressful, uncertain times. But you must take full responsibility for your future. To put it bluntly, the world doesn’t owe you anything. The world is a cruel, mean place where the fittest survive. It’s all a battle. More often enough, though, every day is an intrapersonal mental battle. You fight for self-control to sometimes be defeated by pleasure. You fight for what is right but get defeated for what’s convenient. That’s reality, sadly. It’s not for everybody, but it certainly applies to a lot of bodies. That’s the war we unconsciously fight in. History is written by the victor. Do you want to be written off after the first few pages of a chapter? Or be the one to fight until the story’s end? It’s all your choice. You’re the compass.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            Wars are not won by sheer brute force, but with patience. The meditating monk defeats the ruthless warrior; but the warrior-monk becomes the general.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            Take your time, if needed be. Take a step back, retreat if you must. War is about strategy. A retreat is not an act of cowardice: it’s an act of courage to take a step back and re-evaluate your approach. Alexander the Great didn’t conquer Asia by just marching his army forward — he planned. Genghis Khan didn’t establish the Mongol Empire by just going to wars — he planned. They planned, and they won. Not every plan works, but a bad plan is better than no plan. That’s how PayPal survived the dotcom bust of the early 2000s. That’s how Google became the tech giant that it is now. Of course, we are not like Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Peter Thiel nor Larry Page. But what do we have in common with them? They’re people who went through adversaries. The main difference between you and Alexander the Great is, simply, he died because of a plague. As I assume, that you are still able to read this, you’re still strong, living, and kicking it. You already won a battle that Alexander did not. The point is that you are a great piece of art. People are workers who create history.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            Whatever you may be experiencing now, this too shall pass. What you experienced 5 years ago already passed, and you are now whoever you are today. You will look back 5 years from now and think: I went through a 2-year pandemic. If I can live through that, then I can live through anything.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            From the wise words of Marcus Aurelius, “Pain is just a rough sensation in the body. Nothing more, nothing less. It can’t make us better nor worse, but it is how we respond to it.” And from Ryan Holiday: “What once blocked the way is now the way. What once impeded action now advances action. The obstacle is the way.” </p>
